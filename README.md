# hunters-among-speedrunners-server
Server template for hosting a Hunters Among Speedrunners server

## Note:
We use a mod called Paxi to automatically load datapacks in all worlds. This means that the server will automatically load the HAS datapack into all worlds. The built-in datapack version will likely be outdated when you use this server, so make sure to check if it needs updates. If it does, the Paxi plugin stores datapacks in `config/paxi/datapacks/`, so delete the old datapack and add the new one.
